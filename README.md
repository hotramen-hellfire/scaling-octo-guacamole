# Hi
This was an attempt to create a personal website with a scrapbook/ blog and other editable components. All of the data/ info is bound to the `data.tsx` file in the root of the next project, i.e. in `/octo/data.tsx`. 
# How to use the template
All of the editable features are listed in the `data.tsx` file along with the comments for each of the types. After filling those in you may proceed to build your project. . .
(or even build first and see the changes that `data.tsx` has on the go)
## The Set Up
 1. For the build you need `wsl` on windows as we are going to use `npm`. Install `npm` on `wsl/ linux distro` whatever that you are using.
2. In `/octo` run `npm i` then `npm run dev` to start the development server, follow the localhost link provided to see your website in action.
3. Further you can use your preferred mode of deployment to get your website up. If you are using the `mars.cse.iitb` server, you need to export the static code and set up a redirect as in the `octo/public_html` folder. I use Vercel for deployment, you do need to create a GitHub repo for your code.
(do reach out if you need help in any of the above steps or are not familiar with the development envs)
# BYE :)
